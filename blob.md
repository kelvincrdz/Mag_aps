@vercel/blob
Last updated October 23, 2025
Vercel Blob is available on all plans

Those with the owner, member, developer role can access this feature

Getting started
To start using Vercel Blob SDK, follow the steps below:

You can also interact with Vercel Blob using the Vercel CLI for command-line operations. For example, you might want to quickly upload assets during local development without writing additional code.

Vercel Blob works with any frontend framework. begin by installing the package:

TypeScript
Python
Terminal

pnpm i @vercel/blob
Create a Blob store
Navigate to the Project you'd like to add the blob store to. Select the Storage tab, then select the Connect Database button.

Under the Create New tab, select Blob and then the Continue button.

Choose a name for your store and select Create a new Blob store. Select the environments where you would like the read-write token to be included. You can also update the prefix of the Environment Variable in Advanced Options

Once created, you are taken to the Vercel Blob store page.

Prepare your local project
Since you created the Blob store in a project, environment variables are automatically created and added to the project for you.

BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN
To use this environment variable locally, use the Vercel CLI to pull the values into your local project:

vercel env pull
Read-write token
A read-write token is required to interact with the Blob SDK. When you create a Blob store in your Vercel Dashboard, an environment variable with the value of the token is created for you. You have the following options when deploying your application:

If you deploy your application in the same Vercel project where your Blob store is located, you do not need to specify the token parameter, as it's default value is equal to the store's token environment variable
If you deploy your application in a different Vercel project or scope, you can create an environment variable there and assign the token value from your Blob store settings to this variable. You will then set the token parameter to this environment variable
If you deploy your application outside of Vercel, you can copy the token value from the store settings and pass it as the token parameter when you call a Blob SDK method
Using the SDK methods
In the examples below, we use Fluid compute for optimal performance and scalability.

Upload a blob
This example creates a Function that accepts a file from a multipart/form-data form and uploads it to the Blob store. The function returns a unique URL for the blob.

TypeScript
Python
Next.js (/app)
Next.js (/pages)
Other frameworks
app/upload/route.ts
TypeScript

TypeScript
import { put } from '@vercel/blob';

export async function PUT(request: Request) {
const form = await request.formData();
const file = form.get('file') as File;
const blob = await put(file.name, file, {
access: 'public',
addRandomSuffix: true,
});

return Response.json(blob);
}
put()
The put method uploads a blob object to the Blob store.

TypeScript
Python
put(pathname, body, options);
It accepts the following parameters:

pathname: (Required) A string specifying the base value of the return URL
body: (Required) A blob object as ReadableStream, String, ArrayBuffer or Blob based on these supported body types
options: (Required) A JSON object with the following required and optional parameters:
Parameter Required Values
access Yes public
addRandomSuffix No A boolean specifying whether to add a random suffix to the pathname. It defaults to false. We recommend using this option to ensure there are no conflicts in your blob filenames.
allowOverwrite No A boolean to allow overwriting blobs. By default an error will be thrown if you try to overwrite a blob by using the same pathname for multiple blobs.
cacheControlMaxAge No A number in seconds to configure how long Blobs are cached. Defaults to one month. Cannot be set to a value lower than 1 minute. See the caching documentation for more details.
contentType No A string indicating the media type. By default, it's extracted from the pathname's extension.
token No A string specifying the token to use when making requests. It defaults to process.env.BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN when deployed on Vercel as explained in Read-write token. You can also pass a client token created with the generateClientTokenFromReadWriteToken method
multipart No Pass multipart: true when uploading large files. It will split the file into multiple parts, upload them in parallel and retry failed parts.
abortSignal No An AbortSignal to cancel the operation
onUploadProgress No Callback to track upload progress: onUploadProgress({loaded: number, total: number, percentage: number})
Example code with folder output
To upload your file to an existing folder inside your blob storage, pass the folder name in the pathname as shown below:

TypeScript
Python
const imageFile = formData.get('image') as File;
const blob = await put(`existingBlobFolder/${imageFile.name}`, imageFile, {
access: 'public',
addRandomSuffix: true,
});
Example responses
put() returns a JSON object with the following data for the created blob object:

{
"pathname": "string",
"contentType": "string",
"contentDisposition": "string",
"url": "string",
"downloadUrl": "string"
}
An example blob (uploaded with addRandomSuffix: true) is:

{
"pathname": "profilesv1/user-12345-NoOVGDVcqSPc7VYCUAGnTzLTG2qEM2.txt",
"contentType": "text/plain",
"contentDisposition": "attachment; filename=\"user-12345-NoOVGDVcqSPc7VYCUAGnTzLTG2qEM2.txt\"",
"url": "https://ce0rcu23vrrdzqap.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/profilesv1/user-12345-NoOVGDVcqSPc7VYCUAGnTzLTG2qEM2.txt",
"downloadUrl": "https://ce0rcu23vrrdzqap.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/profilesv1/user-12345-NoOVGDVcqSPc7VYCUAGnTzLTG2qEM2.txt?download=1"
}
An example blob uploaded without addRandomSuffix: true (default) is:

{
"pathname": "profilesv1/user-12345.txt",
"contentType": "text/plain",
"contentDisposition": "attachment; filename=\"user-12345.txt\"",
// no automatic random suffix added 👇
"url": "https://ce0rcu23vrrdzqap.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/profilesv1/user-12345.txt",
"downloadUrl": "https://ce0rcu23vrrdzqap.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/profilesv1/user-12345.txt?download=1"
}
Multipart Uploads
When uploading large files you should use multipart uploads to have a more reliable upload process. A multipart upload splits the file into multiple parts, uploads them in parallel and retries failed parts. This process consists of three phases: creating a multipart upload, uploading the parts and completing the upload. @vercel/blob offers three different ways to create multipart uploads:

Automatic
This method has everything baked in and is easiest to use. It's part of the put and upload API's. Under the hood it will start the upload, split your file into multiple parts with the same size, upload them in parallel and complete the upload.

TypeScript
Python
const blob = await put('large-movie.mp4', file, {
access: 'public',
multipart: true,
});
Manual
This method gives you full control over the multipart upload process. It consists of three phases:

Phase 1: Create a multipart upload

TypeScript
Python
const multipartUpload = await createMultipartUpload(pathname, options);
createMultipartUpload accepts the following parameters:

pathname: (Required) A string specifying the path inside the blob store. This will be the base value of the return URL and includes the filename and extension.
options: (Required) A JSON object with the following required and optional parameters:
Parameter Required Values
access Yes public
contentType No The media type for the file. If not specified, it's derived from the file extension. Falls back to application/octet-stream when no extension exists or can't be matched.
token No A string specifying the token to use when making requests. It defaults to process.env.BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN when deployed on Vercel as explained in Read-write token. You can also pass a client token created with the generateClientTokenFromReadWriteToken method
addRandomSuffix No A boolean specifying whether to add a random suffix to the pathname. It defaults to true.
cacheControlMaxAge No A number in seconds to configure the edge and browser cache. Defaults to one year. See the caching documentation for more details.
abortSignal No An AbortSignal to cancel the operation
createMultipartUpload() returns a JSON object with the following data for the created upload:

{
"key": "string",
"uploadId": "string"
}
Phase 2: Upload all the parts

In the multipart uploader process, it's necessary for you to manage both memory usage and concurrent upload requests. Additionally, each part must be a minimum of 5MB, except the last one which can be smaller, and all parts should be of equal size.

TypeScript
Python
const part = await uploadPart(pathname, chunkBody, options);
uploadPart accepts the following parameters:

pathname: (Required) Same value as the pathname parameter passed to createMultipartUpload
chunkBody: (Required) A blob object as ReadableStream, String, ArrayBuffer or Blob based on these supported body types
options: (Required) A JSON object with the following required and optional parameters:
Parameter Required Values
access Yes public
partNumber Yes A number identifying which part is uploaded
key Yes A string returned from createMultipartUpload which identifies the blob object
uploadId Yes A string returned from createMultipartUpload which identifies the multipart upload
token No A string specifying the token to use when making requests. It defaults to process.env.BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN when deployed on Vercel as explained in Read-write token. You can also pass a client token created with the generateClientTokenFromReadWriteToken method
abortSignal No An AbortSignal to cancel the operation
uploadPart() returns a JSON object with the following data for the uploaded part:

{
"etag": "string",
"partNumber": "string"
}
Phase 3: Complete the multipart upload

TypeScript
Python
const blob = await completeMultipartUpload(pathname, parts, options);
completeMultipartUpload accepts the following parameters:

pathname: (Required) Same value as the pathname parameter passed to createMultipartUpload
parts: (Required) An array containing all the uploaded parts
options: (Required) A JSON object with the following required and optional parameters:
Parameter Required Values
access Yes public
key Yes A string returned from createMultipartUpload which identifies the blob object
uploadId Yes A string returned from createMultipartUpload which identifies the multipart upload
contentType No The media type for the file. If not specified, it's derived from the file extension. Falls back to application/octet-stream when no extension exists or can't be matched.
token No A string specifying the token to use when making requests. It defaults to process.env.BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN when deployed on Vercel as explained in Read-write token. You can also pass a client token created with the generateClientTokenFromReadWriteToken method
addRandomSuffix No A boolean specifying whether to add a random suffix to the pathname. It defaults to true.
cacheControlMaxAge No A number in seconds to configure the edge and browser cache. Defaults to one year. See the caching documentation for more details.
abortSignal No An AbortSignal to cancel the operation
completeMultipartUpload() returns a JSON object with the following data for the created blob object:

{
"pathname": "string",
"contentType": "string",
"contentDisposition": "string",
"url": "string",
"downloadUrl": "string"
}
Uploader
A less verbose way than the manual process is the multipart uploader method. It's a wrapper around the manual multipart upload process and takes care of the data that is the same for all the three multipart phases. This results in a simpler API, but still requires you to handle memory usage and concurrent upload requests.

Phase 1: Create the multipart uploader

TypeScript
Python
const uploader = await createMultipartUploader(pathname, options);
createMultipartUploader accepts the following parameters:

pathname: (Required) A string specifying the path inside the blob store. This will be the base value of the return URL and includes the filename and extension.
options: (Required) A JSON object with the following required and optional parameters:
Parameter Required Values
access Yes public
contentType No The media type for the file. If not specified, it's derived from the file extension. Falls back to application/octet-stream when no extension exists or can't be matched.
token No A string specifying the token to use when making requests. It defaults to process.env.BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN when deployed on Vercel as explained in Read-write token. You can also pass a client token created with the generateClientTokenFromReadWriteToken method
addRandomSuffix No A boolean specifying whether to add a random suffix to the pathname. It defaults to true.
cacheControlMaxAge No A number in seconds to configure the edge and browser cache. Defaults to one year. See the caching documentation for more details.
abortSignal No An AbortSignal to cancel the operation
createMultipartUploader() returns an Uploader object with the following attributes and methods:

TypeScript
Python
{
key: string;
uploadId: string;
uploadPart: (partNumber: number, body: BodyInit) => Promise<Part>;
complete: (parts: Part[]) => Promise<PutBlobResult>;
}
Phase 2: Upload all the parts

In the multipart uploader process, it's necessary for you to manage both memory usage and concurrent upload requests. Additionally, each part must be a minimum of 5MB, except the last one which can be smaller, and all parts should be of equal size.

TypeScript
Python
const part1 = await uploader.uploadPart(1, chunkBody1);
const part2 = await uploader.uploadPart(2, chunkBody2);
const part3 = await uploader.uploadPart(3, chunkBody3);
uploader.uploadPart accepts the following parameters:

partNumber: (Required) A number identifying which part is uploaded
chunkBody: (Required) A blob object as ReadableStream, String, ArrayBuffer or Blob based on these supported body types
uploader.uploadPart() returns an object with the following data for the uploaded part:

TypeScript
Python
{
etag: string;
partNumber: string;
}
Phase 3: Complete the multipart upload

TypeScript
Python
const blob = await uploader.complete([part1, part2, part3]);
uploader.complete accepts the following parameters:

parts: (Required) An array containing all the uploaded parts
uploader.complete() returns an object with the following data for the created blob object:

TypeScript
Python
{
pathname: string;
contentType: string;
contentDisposition: string;
url: string;
downloadUrl: string;
}
Deleting blobs
This example creates a function that deletes a blob object from the Blob store. You can delete multiple blob objects in a single request by passing an array of blob URLs.

Next.js (/app)
Next.js (/pages)
Other frameworks
app/delete/route.ts
TypeScript

TypeScript
import { del } from '@vercel/blob';

export async function DELETE(request: Request) {
const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url);
const urlToDelete = searchParams.get('url') as string;
await del(urlToDelete);

return new Response();
}
del()
The del method deletes one or multiple blob objects from the Blob store.

Since blobs are cached, it may take up to one minute for them to be fully removed from the Vercel CDN cache.

TypeScript
Python
del(urlOrPathname, options);

del([urlOrPathname], options); // You can pass an array to delete multiple blob objects
It accepts the following parameters:

urlOrPathname: (Required) A string or array of strings specifying the URL(s) or pathname(s) of the blob object(s) to delete.
options: (Optional) A JSON object with the following optional parameter:
Parameter Required Values
token No A string specifying the read-write token to use when making requests. It defaults to process.env.BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN when deployed on Vercel as explained in Read-write token
abortSignal No An AbortSignal to cancel the operation
del() returns a void response. A delete action is always successful if the blob url exists. A delete action won't throw if the blob url doesn't exists.

Get blob metadata
This example creates a Function that returns a blob object's metadata.

Next.js (/app)
Next.js (/pages)
Other frameworks
app/get-blob/route.ts
TypeScript

TypeScript
import { head } from '@vercel/blob';

export async function GET(request: Request) {
const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url);
const blobUrl = searchParams.get('url');
const blobDetails = await head(blobUrl);

return Response.json(blobDetails);
}
head()
The head method returns a blob object's metadata.

TypeScript
Python
head(urlOrPathname, options);
It accepts the following parameters:

urlOrPathname: (Required) A string specifying the URL or pathname of the blob object to read.
options: (Optional) A JSON object with the following optional parameter:
Parameter Required Values
token No A string specifying the read-write token to use when making requests. It defaults to process.env.BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN when deployed on Vercel as explained in Read-write token
abortSignal No An AbortSignal to cancel the operation
head() returns one of the following:

a JSON object with the requested blob object's metadata
throws a BlobNotFoundError if the blob object was not found
TypeScript
Python
{
size: number;
uploadedAt: Date;
pathname: string;
contentType: string;
contentDisposition: string;
url: string;
downloadUrl: string;
cacheControl: string;
}
List blobs
This example creates a Function that returns a list of blob objects in a Blob store.

Next.js (/app)
Next.js (/pages)
Other frameworks
app/get-blobs/route.ts
TypeScript

TypeScript
import { list } from '@vercel/blob';

export async function GET(request: Request) {
const { blobs } = await list();
return Response.json(blobs);
}
list()
The list method returns a list of blob objects in a Blob store.

TypeScript
Python
list(options);
It accepts the following parameters:

options: (Optional) A JSON object with the following optional parameters:
Parameter Required Values
token No A string specifying the read-write token to use when making requests. It defaults to process.env.BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN when deployed on Vercel as explained in Read-write token
limit No A number specifying the maximum number of blob objects to return. It defaults to 1000
prefix No A string used to filter for blob objects contained in a specific folder assuming that the folder name was used in the pathname when the blob object was uploaded
cursor No A string obtained from a previous list response to be used for reading the next page of results
mode No A string specifying the response format. Can either be expanded (default) or folded. In folded mode all blobs that are located inside a folder will be folded into a single folder string entry
abortSignal No An AbortSignal to cancel the operation
list() returns a JSON object in the following format:

TypeScript
Python
{
blobs: {
size: number;
uploadedAt: Date;
pathname: string;
url: string;
downloadUrl: string;
}[];
cursor?: string;
hasMore: boolean;
folders?: string[];
}
Pagination
For a long list of blob objects (the default list limit is 1000), you can use the cursor and hasMore parameters to paginate through the results as shown in the example below:

TypeScript
Python
let hasMore = true;
let cursor;

while (hasMore) {
const listResult = await list({
cursor,
});

hasMore = listResult.hasMore;
cursor = listResult.cursor;
}
Folders
To retrieve the folders from your blob store, alter the mode parameter to modify the response format of the list operation. The default value of mode is expanded, which returns all blobs in a single array of objects.

Alternatively, you can set mode to folded to roll up all blobs located inside a folder into a single entry. These entries will be included in the response as folders. Blobs that are not located in a folder will still be returned in the blobs property.

By using the folded mode, you can efficiently retrieve folders and subsequently list the blobs inside them by using the returned folders as a prefix for further requests. Omitting the prefix parameter entirely, will return all folders in the root of your store. Be aware that the blobs pathnames and the folder names will always be fully quantified and never relative to the prefix you passed.

TypeScript
Python
const {
folders: [firstFolder],
blobs: rootBlobs,
} = await list({ mode: 'folded' });

const { folders, blobs } = await list({ mode: 'folded', prefix: firstFolder });
Copy a blob
This example creates a Function that copies an existing blob to a new path in the store.

Next.js (/app)
Next.js (/pages)
Other frameworks
app/copy-blob/route.ts
TypeScript

TypeScript
import { copy } from '@vercel/blob';

export async function PUT(request: Request) {
const form = await request.formData();

const fromUrl = form.get('fromUrl') as string;
const toPathname = form.get('toPathname') as string;

const blob = await copy(fromUrl, toPathname, { access: 'public' });

return Response.json(blob);
}
copy()
The copy method copies an existing blob object to a new path inside the blob store.

The contentType and cacheControlMaxAge will not be copied from the source blob. If the values should be carried over to the copy, they need to be defined again in the options object.

Contrary to put(), addRandomSuffix is false by default. This means no automatic random id suffix is added to your blob url, unless you pass addRandomSuffix: true. This also means copy() overwrites files per default, if the operation targets a pathname that already exists.

TypeScript
Python
copy(fromUrlOrPathname, toPathname, options);
It accepts the following parameters:

fromUrlOrPathname: (Required) A blob URL or pathname identifying an already existing blob
toPathname: (Required) A string specifying the new path inside the blob store. This will be the base value of the return URL
options: (Required) A JSON object with the following required and optional parameters:
Parameter Required Values
access Yes public
contentType No A string indicating the media type. By default, it's extracted from the toPathname's extension.
token No A string specifying the token to use when making requests. It defaults to process.env.BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN when deployed on Vercel as explained in Read-write token
addRandomSuffix No A boolean specifying whether to add a random suffix to the pathname. It defaults to false.
cacheControlMaxAge No A number in seconds to configure the edge and browser cache. Defaults to one year. See the caching documentation for more details.
abortSignal No An AbortSignal to cancel the operation
copy() returns a JSON object with the following data for the copied blob object:

TypeScript
Python
{
pathname: string;
contentType: string;
contentDisposition: string;
url: string;
downloadUrl: string;
}
An example blob is:

{
"pathname": "profilesv1/user-12345-copy.txt",
"contentType": "text/plain",
"contentDisposition": "attachment; filename=\"user-12345-copy.txt\"",
"url": "https://ce0rcu23vrrdzqap.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/profilesv1/user-12345-copy.txt",
"downloadUrl": "https://ce0rcu23vrrdzqap.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/profilesv1/user-12345-copy.txt?download=1"
}
Client uploads
As seen in the client uploads quickstart docs, you can upload files directly from clients (like browsers) to the Blob store.

All client uploads related methods are available under @vercel/blob/client.

upload()
The upload method is dedicated to client uploads. It fetches a client token on your server using the handleUploadUrl before uploading the blob. Read the client uploads documentation to learn more.

upload(pathname, body, options);
It accepts the following parameters:

pathname: (Required) A string specifying the base value of the return URL
body: (Required) A blob object as ReadableStream, String, ArrayBuffer or Blob based on these supported body types
options: (Required) A JSON object with the following required and optional parameters:
Parameter Required Values
access Yes public
contentType No A string indicating the media type. By default, it's extracted from the pathname's extension.
handleUploadUrl Yes\* A string specifying the route to call for generating client tokens for client uploads.
clientPayload No A string to be sent to your handleUpload server code. Example use-case: attaching the post id an image relates to. So you can use it to update your database.
multipart No Pass multipart: true when uploading large files. It will split the file into multiple parts, upload them in parallel and retry failed parts.
abortSignal No An AbortSignal to cancel the operation
onUploadProgress No Callback to track upload progress: onUploadProgress({loaded: number, total: number, percentage: number})
upload() returns a JSON object with the following data for the created blob object:

{
pathname: string;
contentType: string;
contentDisposition: string;
url: string;
downloadUrl: string;
}
An example url is:

https://ce0rcu23vrrdzqap.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/profilesv1/user-12345-NoOVGDVcqSPc7VYCUAGnTzLTG2qEM2.txt
handleUpload()
A server-side route helper to manage client uploads, it has two responsibilities:

Generate tokens for client uploads
Listen for completed client uploads, so you can update your database with the URL of the uploaded file for example
handleUpload(options);
It accepts the following parameters:

options: (Required) A JSON object with the following parameters:
Parameter Required Values
token No A string specifying the read-write token to use when making requests. It defaults to process.env.BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN when deployed on Vercel as explained in Read-write token
request Yes An IncomingMessage or Request object to be used to determine the action to take
onBeforeGenerateToken Yes A function to be called right before generating client tokens for client uploads. See below for usage
onUploadCompleted Yes A function to be called by Vercel Blob when the client upload finishes. This is useful to update your database with the blob url that was uploaded
body Yes The request body
handleUpload() returns:

Promise<
| { type: 'blob.generate-client-token'; clientToken: string }
| { type: 'blob.upload-completed'; response: 'ok' }

> ;
> onBeforeGenerateToken()
> The onBeforeGenerateToken function receives the following arguments:

pathname: The destination path for the blob
clientPayload: A string payload specified on the client when calling upload()
multipart: A boolean specifying whether the file is a multipart upload.
The function must return an object with the following properties:

Parameter Required Values
addRandomSuffix No A boolean specifying whether to add a random suffix to the pathname. It defaults to false. We recommend using this option to ensure there are no conflicts in your blob filenames.
allowedContentTypes No An array of strings specifying the media type that are allowed to be uploaded. By default, it's all content types. Wildcards are supported (text/\*)
maximumSizeInBytes No A number specifying the maximum size in bytes that can be uploaded. The maximum is 5TB.
validUntil No A number specifying the timestamp in ms when the token will expire. By default, it's now + 1 hour.
allowOverwrite No A boolean to allow overwriting blobs. By default an error will be thrown if you try to overwrite a blob by using the same pathname for multiple blobs.
cacheControlMaxAge No A number in seconds to configure how long Blobs are cached. Defaults to one month. Cannot be set to a value lower than 1 minute. See the caching documentation for more details.
callbackUrl No A string specifying the URL that Vercel Blob will call when the upload completes. See client uploads for examples.
tokenPayload No A string specifying a payload to be sent to your server on upload completion.
onUploadCompleted()
The onUploadCompleted function receives the following arguments:

blob: The blob that was uploaded. See the return type of put() for more details.
tokenPayload: The payload that was defined in the onBeforeGenerateToken() function.
Client uploads routes
Here's an example Next.js App Router route handler that uses handleUpload():

app/api/post/upload/route.ts
import { handleUpload, type HandleUploadBody } from '@vercel/blob/client';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

// Use-case: uploading images for blog posts
export async function POST(request: Request): Promise<NextResponse> {
const body = (await request.json()) as HandleUploadBody;

try {
const jsonResponse = await handleUpload({
body,
request,
onBeforeGenerateToken: async (pathname, clientPayload) => {
// Generate a client token for the browser to upload the file
// ⚠️ Authenticate and authorize users before generating the token.
// Otherwise, you're allowing anonymous uploads.

        // ⚠️ When using the clientPayload feature, make sure to validate it
        // otherwise this could introduce security issues for your app
        // like allowing users to modify other users' posts

        return {
          allowedContentTypes: [
            // optional, default to all content types
            'image/jpeg',
            'image/png',
            'image/webp',
            'text/*',
          ],
          // callbackUrl: 'https://example.com/api/avatar/upload',
          // optional, `callbackUrl` is automatically computed when hosted on Vercel
        };
      },
      onUploadCompleted: async ({ blob, tokenPayload }) => {
        // Get notified of client upload completion
        // ⚠️ This will not work on `localhost` websites,
        // Use ngrok or similar to get the full upload flow

        console.log('blob upload completed', blob, tokenPayload);

        try {
          // Run any logic after the file upload completed,
          // If you've already validated the user and authorization prior, you can
          // safely update your database
        } catch (error) {
          throw new Error('Could not update post');
        }
      },
    });

    return NextResponse.json(jsonResponse);

} catch (error) {
return NextResponse.json(
{ error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error) },
{ status: 400 }, // The webhook will retry 5 times waiting for a 200
);
}
}
Handling errors
When you make a request to the SDK using any of the above methods, they will return an error if the request fails due to any of the following reasons:

Missing required parameters
An invalid token or a token that does have access to the Blob object
Suspended Blob store
Blob file or Blob store not found
Unforeseen or unknown errors
To catch these errors, wrap your requests with a try/catch statement as shown below:

TypeScript
Python
import { put, BlobAccessError } from '@vercel/blob';

try {
await put(...);
} catch (error) {
if (error instanceof BlobAccessError) {
// handle a recognized error
} else {
// throw the error again if it's unknown
throw error;
}
}
